Instruction through Codio is built around the guides feature. This is a brief description on how the demo on the previous page was built. Please see the [**documentation**](https://docs.codio.com/authoring.html) for more information about content authoring with guides.

### Build on this Starter Pack
---
Please note that this Starter Pack uses the Codio-Certified Jeroo Stack.

Follow the directions below to build out this project with your own activities in Jeroo:

### Files
---

	* Program File: `.jsc` suffix

2. In your `.jsc` file, edit your map as you would like. Add flowers or nets and/or adjust water or grass.

3. **Save your island to the server** by selecting the icon under "Island File". It will ask you name your `.jev` island file. You will notice the file appears in your **FileTree**.

### Page Layout
---
Each page in the guide can have its own layout. You can select how many panels you want, and what information goes in each panel. Click the wrench in the top-right corner of your guide. You can select the layout from here. 

When setting up Jeroo, click the settings wrench icon and select **2 Panels without a tree.** Navigate to **Open Tabs** and drag the `.jev` file under **Add Tab.** Position the `.jev` file in panel 0. The guide will be in panel 1.
